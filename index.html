      <h3>Provincial Flower: Pitcher Plant (Sarracenia Purpurea)</h3>
      <div class="art">
        <p>
          Although it was not declared the provincial flower of Newfoundland and
          Labrador until 1954

          <br />
          this strange plant appeared on the Newfoundland penny during the late
          1880s. The pitcher <br />
          plant is found primarily in bogs and marshland throughout the
          province. It has a large <br />
          wine-red flower and hollow pitcher-shaped leaves are attached to the
          base of the stem. An <br />insectivorous plant, it feeds off insects
          that become trapped inside when the leaves fill with <br />water.

      <h3>Provincial Tree: Black Spruce (Picea Mariana)</h3>
      <div class="art">
        <p>
          Designated as the provincial tree in November 1993, it is also known
          as the bog spruce.
          <br />
          Although dark bluish-green in colour, it is called the "black" spruce
          to distinguish it from other <br />
          types of spruce trees. An evergreen coniferous tree, it is tolerant of
          nutrient-deficient soils, <br />
          growing primarily in areas that have poor drainage. The black spruce
          is the most abundant tree <br />
          in Labrador and appears on the Labrador flag.

      <h3>Provincial Bird: Atlantic Puffin (Fratercula Arctica)</h3>
      <div class="art">
        <p>
          The puffin has officially been the provincial bird of Newfoundland and
          Labrador since 1991. It
          <br />
          is a member of the auk family. The puffin is also called the sea
          parrot because of its multi- <br />
          coloured beak. Marine birds that inhabit cliffs, puffins can dive 50
          metres underwater in search <br />
          of food. Their diet consists mostly of small fish such as caplin and
          herring. Their wing span is <br />
          approximately 55 cm., and they can fly up to 80 km. per hour. Puffins
          spend the majority of <br />
          their lives on the water. They live approximately 25 years, usually
          mate for life, and produce one <br />
          egg per year. Witless Bay, Newfoundland, is home to the largest puffin
          colony in North America.

      <h3>Provincial Mineral: Labradorite</h3>

      <div class="art">
        <p>
          A mineral discovered in northern Labrador, it was first described by
          Moravian missionaries in
          <br />
          the late 18th century and brought to Europe. An iridescent crystalline
          mineral, it is from the <br />
          plagioclase feldspar group. It is prized for its beautiful shifting
          iridescent colours of blue, green, <br />
          grey and bronze. Found largely in the Nain area of Labrador, it is
          being mined at Ten Mile Bay <br />
          by the Labrador Inuit Association. Labradorite is commonly used in
          ornamentation for <br />
          buildings and in making jewelry.

      <h3>Provincial Tartan</h3>

      <div class="art">
        <p>
          The provincial tartan was developed in 1955 by Sam Wilansky, a
          clothing store owner on Water

          <br />
          Street in St. John's. The tartan is predominantly green with gold,
          white, brown and red bands of <br />
          colour. He chose most of the colours to correspond with The Ode to
          Newfoundland.
